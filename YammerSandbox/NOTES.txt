
Environment Setup
1. Eclipse Juno (4.2) SR2
2. Sign-up for Google App Engine (https://appengine.google.com/)
2. Install Google Plug-in for Eclipse (http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/4.2)
   ** Install everything except "NDK Plugins". 
3. Need JDK installed to compile JSP files.
4. Need JSON parser (Jackson vs. GSon)
5. Currently doing OAuth manually, Scribe doesn't seem to work for Yammer.
   ** Google's OAuth won't work, it's Google Accounts specific.

LEFT OFF
* Got the OAuth flow working to the point of receiving the initial JSON response with user details.
* Next up is to make an independent REST query of the APIs.
* Probably will need a framework for making these queries (vs URLConnection).
